Suddenly late at night
惊觉夜色已深
I write a message
我执笔写下
From my fears come words that ring ture
那惊惶之余的真情
and I hope that maybe they'll sooth you
或许它能给你些许慰藉
Whether days are clear or gray
无论烈日晴空
or lightning fills the skies
哪管骤雨狂风
Know I'll stay here next to you
我都不离不弃
I will be here by your side
我都无怨无悔
Through the darkness and the pain
忘却坎坷与风霜
and regrets that fill you so,
放下悔恨与伤痛
raise your head and march on forwards
昂首阔步路在前方
breathe deep and just let it all go
吐故纳新往事如梦
Then together we can see
我们将一同期冀
all the things still yet to be
那些未成现实的愿景
And if your heart can't go on this way
如果你仍在怀疑
remember what I'd say
那就想想我的话语
After tears always comes a smile
阳光总在风雨后
no matter how much you may cry.
泪水凝结是笑容
Whether lost or sad or broken down,
悲伤崩溃或彷徨
you can find your wings and be alright
振翅拨云见阳光
All you are is all I hold dear,
此命珍爱惟一名
so please feel my heart beat for you.
此心跳动为一姓
And dawn will always come again,
太阳照常升起
so come on, don't give up now.
因此，何言放弃
Time flies forward 
光阴似箭
and with it your dreams come closer
而梦想更近
Just take a step then together,
勇敢迈步共同前行
in fields of gold we will see the light!
麦田的金光预示着希望！
